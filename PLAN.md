## Architecture Decisions Made

### Caching Strategy
- **Format**: CSV + gzip compression for portability and human readability
- **Naming**: `{datasource}_{region}_{period}.csv.gz` (e.g., `energycharts_DE_2023-11.csv.gz`)
- **Granularity**: Whole months for past data, flexible periods for current month
- **Benefits**: Universal compatibility, easy inspection, clear data attribution

### Day Type Classification
- **Strategy**: Treat weekends and public holidays equivalently for electricity analysis
- **Rationale**: Both represent reduced economic activity and different consumption patterns
- **Implementation**: Three categories: `workday`, `weekend`, `holiday` (combine latter two for analysis)

### DST Handling Approach
- **Phase 1**: Simple hour-of-day averaging, ignore DST complexity initially
- **Future**: UTC-based analysis or local solar time approximation
- **Rationale**: Duck curve analysis more important than DST precision initially

### Visualization Philosophy
- **Terminal-first**: Fast, dependency-light, SSH-friendly
- **Human-readable**: Clear labels, appropriate scaling, informative summaries
- **Progressive complexity**: Basic charts first, advanced analysis optional
