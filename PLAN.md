## Architecture Decisions Made

### Caching Strategy
- **Format**: CSV + gzip compression for portability and human readability
- **Naming**: `{datasource}_{region}_{period}.csv.gz` (e.g., `energycharts_DE_2023-11.csv.gz`)
- **Granularity**: Whole months for past data, flexible periods for current month
- **Benefits**: Universal compatibility, easy inspection, clear data attribution

### Day Type Classification
- **Strategy**: Treat weekends and public holidays equivalently for electricity analysis
- **Rationale**: Both represent reduced economic activity and different consumption patterns
- **Implementation**: Three categories: `workday`, `weekend`, `holiday` (combine latter two for analysis)

### DST Handling Approach
- **Phase 1**: Simple hour-of-day averaging, ignore DST complexity initially
- **Future**: UTC-based analysis or local solar time approximation
- **Rationale**: Duck curve analysis more important than DST precision initially

### Visualization Philosophy
- **Terminal-first**: Fast, dependency-light, SSH-friendly
- **Human-readable**: Clear labels, appropriate scaling, informative summaries
- **Progressive complexity**: Basic charts first, advanced analysis optional

3. **Fixed Duplicate Parameters**: Resolved CLI warnings about duplicate `--output` parameters
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All commands (`chart`, `duck-factor`, `negative-pricing`) now have unified output handling

#### üìà Usage Examples

4. **Smart X-Axis**: Automatic formatting (YYYY-MM-DD for daily, YYYY-Wxx for weekly, YYYY-MM for monthly)

#### üìà Enhanced Usage Examples
```bash
# Daily timechart (default)
angry-pixie negative-pricing --region DE --start-date 2024 --chart-type timechart

# Weekly aggregation 
angry-pixie negative-pricing --region DE --start-date 2024-05 --chart-type timechart --aggregation-level weekly

# Monthly aggregation with PNG output
angry-pixie negative-pricing --region AT --start-date 2024 --chart-type timechart --aggregation-level monthly --png

# Creates: images/negative-pricing-timechart-monthly_at_20240101_20250613.png
```

#### üé® Aggregation Benefits
The new aggregation levels provide different analytical perspectives with comparable scales:
- **Daily**: Fine-grained view of day-to-day variations, seasonal trends (0-24 hours)
- **Weekly**: Average daily hours within weeks, smoothed medium-term trends (0-24 hours avg)
- **Monthly**: Average daily hours within months, long-term seasonal patterns (0-24 hours avg)
- **Multi-year Analysis**: Clear visualization of renewable energy adoption progress

**Key Fix**: Weekly and monthly aggregations show average daily hours within each period, making all aggregation levels directly comparable on the same 0-24 hour scale.
